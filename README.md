# praqma-docs-demo
Example of using our praqma-docs jekyll site layout for simple Github page.

## Steps to use our common layout to get a github page

* clone your repository
* create a `docs` folder in repo root
* copy content (folders) from https://github.com/Praqma/praqma-docs into the `docs` folder. _Yes, very ugly! - but that is the problem we will try to solve_.
* add and `index.md` to the `docs` folder, with a simple header and paragraph
